📝 Guide: Creating and Running Your Script to Check Websites

1. Create the script file

In the terminal, create the file:

nano script9.1.py

2. Add the Python code

Paste the following code:

#!/usr/bin/python3
# Website Existence Checker in Python
# Usage: python3 script9.1.py

import requests

# Test with a URL (you can use a non-existent one)
site = requests.get("http://example.com")
status = site.status_code

if status == 200:
    print("Page exists")
else:
    print("Page does not exist")


⚠️ Note: For educational purposes, you can test with non-existent URLs safely.

3. Run the script
python3 script9.1.py

4. Example output

Existing URL:

Page exists


Non-existent URL:

Page does not exist

👉 What you learned here

requests.get() → sends an HTTP request to the website.

.status_code → returns the HTTP status code (200 → OK, 404 → Not Found, etc.).

if statement → checks conditions and executes different actions based on the result.
